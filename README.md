# Jquery_notetaker

#A simple notetaking app in HTML, CSS, and JS/JQuery.

#A user can add notes and view them.

#A user can edit notes once created.

#A user can delete notes.

#A user can select a color for each note (corresponding to categories), from a fixed list of colors.

#A user, while editing a note, can edit the color/category by selecting a different radio button.

#Completed in a little over an hour. With more time, I would invest in prettier CSS and better UI.
